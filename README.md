Learn Python 3 the Hard Way (2017, Zed Shaw)

I figured, while learing Python I could also learn how to use Git.  I am quickly discovering Git would have greatly increased my productivity for the first have of my masters program in CS.  I could have been using Git instead of gdrive as my conduit between editing in Windows and running on Raspberry Pi instances.  I will be putting this to the test soon.
